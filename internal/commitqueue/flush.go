// path is ignored by git (a repo-level `.wipnote/` rule, for example — GH#172).
// Such an intent is not poison: it is a correct intent against a repository
// configured to refuse it. flushLocked therefore treats it as a
// MISCONFIGURATION rather than a failure — no Attempts increment, never
// dead-lettered — and reports it per intent so the operator sees the cause
// instead of an ever-growing retry count.

// Committer performs the actual git commit for one intent. It returns nil on
// success (including the idempotent "nothing to commit" no-op) and a non-nil
// error on a real failure (locked index, hook rejection, etc.). Production
// wires this to a func that calls runGitMutation under the repo-scoped advisory
// lock; tests inject a stub so they never touch real git.
//
// The committer MUST be idempotent: because flush rewrites the outbox only
// AFTER a commit is confirmed, an interrupted flush re-runs the committer for
// intents whose commit already landed. The underlying artifact commit treats an
// already-committed file as a "nothing to commit" no-op, so re-running is safe.

	RemainingDepth  int // pending intents still queued after this pass

// Flush drains the outbox in FIFO order, committing each intent via commit.
//
// Ordering & atomicity:
//   - Intents are processed oldest-first.
//   - An intent is removed from the pending file ONLY after its commit is
//     confirmed (commit returned nil) — so a crash before the rewrite re-flushes
//     it, relying on commit idempotency to avoid double-commit harm.
//   - On commit failure the intent's Attempts is incremented and it stays
//     queued. Once Attempts reaches maxAttempts it is moved to the dead-letter
//     log and removed from pending, so one poison intent never freezes the
//     ordered queue — subsequent intents are still attempted in the same pass.
//
// The whole pending file is rewritten once at the end with exactly the intents
// that should remain (failed-but-under-threshold, in original order). This
// keeps the rewrite a single atomic rename rather than one-per-intent.
//
// maxAttempts <= 0 falls back to the package default MaxAttempts.
