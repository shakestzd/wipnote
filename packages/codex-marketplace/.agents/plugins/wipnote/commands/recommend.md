The command displays:
- **Project Health** — Counts of features, bugs, spikes, tracks by status
- **WIP Status** — Current in-progress work against your limit
- **Bottlenecks** — Stale or overloaded items blocking progress
- **Recommended Work** — Top N items scored by priority and impact

## Instructions for Claude

This command invokes `erinn recommend` via the CLI, which provides all analytics in one unified output.

**Key workflow:**
1. Run `erinn recommend [--top N]` where N is user's choice or default 5
2. Present the output with light markdown formatting
3. Analyze the **recommended items** for parallel execution opportunities
4. Propose next action: either parallel launch or sequential plan
