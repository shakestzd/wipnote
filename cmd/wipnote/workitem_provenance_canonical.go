// Canonical provenance lookups for the completion gates (feat-fc3cc9e0).
//
// These replace core/db.GetCommitsByFeature / core/db.CodeBearingPaths, which
// read the per-project SQLite read-index that no longer exists. Both facts the
// gates need are recoverable from durable, committed state:
//
//   - LINKED COMMITS are Git-derived. wipnote's commit convention puts the work
//     item ID in the message — parenthesised "(feat-abc12345)" or an explicit
//     "Refs:"/"Fixes:" trailer — and `wipnote reindex` has always rebuilt
//     git_commits.feature_id by parsing exactly that (reindex_trailers.go). We
//     read the same source directly instead of the table derived from it, so
//     the gate sees identical linkage without an index.
//
//   - CODE-BEARING PATHS are the files those commits touched (git diff-tree,
//     via the batched commitFilesByHash helper reindexFeatureFiles already
//     uses), UNION — only when the item carries zero linked commits — the
//     uncommitted source in the working tree. The second half is what keeps the
//     gate non-vacuous: with commit-derived paths alone, "code-bearing" would
//     imply "has commits" and the gate could never fire. It is scoped to items
//     with canonical evidence that an agent actually implemented them (an
//     implemented_in session edge on the artifact, or a claim-ledger episode),
//     so a hand-written docs item completed in a dirty tree stays exempt.
//
// KNOWN NARROWING vs the old feature_files table: that table also carried
// per-tool-call file touches recorded live by the hooks. Those rows lived only
// in the derived index — the canonical record of them is the multi-hundred-MB
// per-session events NDJSON, which cannot be scanned synchronously on a
// completion path. An item whose implementation was committed WITHOUT its ID in
// the message, in an otherwise clean tree, therefore now reads as not
// code-bearing and is exempt. That is the honest answer: no durable artifact
// links it to any source change, so there is nothing for the gate to point at.

// canonicalLinkedCommits returns the commits that carry provenance for
// workItemID, from BOTH canonical sources:
//
//  1. Explicit committed_in edges on the item's own artifact, written by
//     `wipnote link-commit` (link_commit.go). These come first because they are
//     a deliberate human assertion of provenance.
//  2. Commits whose MESSAGE names the item under wipnote's convention.
//
// The union is not optional. Source 2 alone cannot see a manually linked
// commit — and a commit that does not name its item is the entire reason
// `link-commit` exists — so a message-only gate would keep refusing completion
// after the user had already supplied the provenance it was asking for.
//
// node may be nil (the artifact could not be read), in which case only the
// message-derived half contributes.
//
// `git log --all` is deliberate: provenance exists as soon as the work is
// committed somewhere reachable, even on a branch not yet merged to HEAD.
// --fixed-strings --grep narrows the walk to candidate messages cheaply; each
// candidate is then confirmed with parseTrailers, the SAME parser the reindex
// path uses, so a stray mention of the ID in unrelated prose does not count as
// linkage.
