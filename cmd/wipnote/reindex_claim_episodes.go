// committed asynchronously through the commit queue. An episode written but not
// yet flushed would be invisible to a git-diff-driven pass, which is precisely
// the window in which attribution queries run.

// The purge before ingest is what keeps archiving honest: compaction deletes a
// shard and folds its rows into archive.html, so without a purge the read index
// would carry the episode twice under the old and new source_file.

// reindexActiveWorkItems projects the OPEN claim episodes into the
// active_work_items table. Returns the number of rows written.
//
// active_work_items is single-mutable-slot CURRENT state — "what does this
// agent hold right now", keyed (session_id, agent_id). The claim ledger records
// the same facts as INTERVALS, and an interval with no end is exactly a live
// claim, so current state is a projection of the ledger rather than an
// independent source. core/claimledger's package doc states that relationship
// directly; this pass is it, expressed in code.
//
// Why it has to exist: at runtime the hooks write active_work_items directly,
// and before feat-fc3cc9e0 those rows persisted in the project database. They
// no longer do — the read index is rebuilt per process from canonical artifacts
// — so without this pass the table is empty in every CLI invocation. That is
// not a cosmetic gap: sessions.active_feature_id reads flow through it, and
// GetResumableSessionForSessionAndWorkItem / ListHarnessGroupedResumableSessions
// both LEFT JOIN it, so an empty table silently turns every `wipnote continue`
// into "no resumable session metadata found".
//
// Ordering: must run after reindexClaimEpisodes, which is its input. It has no
// foreign key to sessions and registers nothing in validIDs, so its position
// relative to the session and edge passes is otherwise free.
//
// Last-open-wins on conflict. Two open episodes for one (session, agent) is a
// ledger inconsistency rather than a state to represent — the PK admits one row
// — so the most recently started claim is taken as current, which is what a
// re-claim without an explicit release looks like.

// This is the same current-state fact as active_work_items reached by a
// different key — "what is this SESSION on" rather than "what is this
// (session, agent) pair on" — and GetActiveFeatureIDForSession reads it
// directly. reindexSessionLedger does not populate the column, so without this
// it is NULL for every session in the projection.
//
// ORDERING: this MUST run after reindexSessionLedger, because it updates rows
// that pass inserts, and after reindexActiveWorkItems, which is its input.
// That places it in the edge phase even though it is conceptually node state —
// hydrateEdgePasses is the first point where both inputs exist.
//
// Which claim counts as "the session's" is not simply the root sentinel, and
// the difference is harness-shaped:
//
//   - Claude Code spawns subagents into the ROOT'S session id, distinguishing
//     them by agent_id, and the top-level owner writes AgentRootSentinel. A
//     subagent holding a different item must NOT overwrite what the session as
//     a whole is on, so the sentinel claim wins when one exists.
//   - Codex spawns subagents into their own sessions, and its launcher writes
//     its own agent id ("codex") rather than the sentinel. Keying on the
//     sentinel alone therefore leaves a Codex session's active_feature_id NULL
//     (TestRunWiSetStatus_CodexLauncherWritesLegacyColumn).
//
// The rule below is deliberately the NARROW one — sentinel only — and the Codex
// case is left failing rather than papered over. The obvious widening, "fall
// back to a claim whose session_id equals its root_session_id", does not work:
// a Claude Code SUBAGENT satisfies that too (it shares the root's session id),
// so the widening silently breaks
// TestRunWiSetStatus_SubagentsDoNotStompLegacyColumn — an attribution
// correctness guard. Verified by trying it.
//
// Nothing in the ledger separates "Codex launcher claim" from "Claude Code
// subagent claim": both are (session_id == root_session_id, non-sentinel
// agent_id). Closing this needs either the launchers to agree on writing the
// sentinel for the top-level owner, or the ledger to record which agent is the
// session's owner. That is a contract decision, not a query fix.
