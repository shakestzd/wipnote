// SQLite writable-open enforcement boundary — slice 5 of plan-ae0c37b2.
//
// Architectural rule: there must be exactly one writer process per project
// database. Slice 6 introduces the dedicated writer service. Without an
// enforcement gate, the codebase can drift back into "queue PLUS direct
// writable opens", which silently recreates the SQLITE_BUSY contention the
// plan is trying to eliminate.
//
// This file is the enforcement boundary. It maintains an explicit inventory
// of every first-party Go callsite that opens a writable SQLite handle and
// fails the build when:
//
//  1. A new writable open appears in a forbidden path (hook, collector,
//     indexer, event-capture) without being added to the inventory.
//  2. An inventory entry no longer matches a real callsite (stale entry).
//  3. A forbidden-path entry is mis-classified as something other than
//     daemon-routed-pending-slice-6.
//
// SCOPE — IMPORTANT:
//
// This boundary scans first-party Go source under cmd/, internal/ ONLY.
// (plugin/ is markdown / static assets only — verified at scan time.)
// MCP servers, third-party plugins, and external tools that open the DB
// file directly are EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE — Go-level enforcement cannot
// reach them. That is a known limitation documented in the plan's review
// critique (review-2026-05-11) and surfaced in the inventory comment for
// the receiver/writer entry.
//
// HOW TO EXTEND:
//
//  - New canonical-first command: no inventory change needed (does not open DB).
//  - New CLI command that legitimately mutates work items: add to inventory
//    with classification "intentional-cli-mutation".
//  - New reindex command: add with "reindex-only".
//  - New schema migration runner: add with "migration-only".
//  - New hook / collector / indexer write path: STOP. Route it through the
//    writer service introduced by slice 6 (feat-f3bcbcef). Do not add a
//    direct open here.
