// SQLite writable-open enforcement boundary — slice 5 of plan-ae0c37b2,
// updated through slice 7 (plan-2390966a), and again for feat-fc3cc9e0.
//
// Architectural rule: there must be exactly one writer process per project
// database. Slice 6 introduced the dedicated writer service; slice 7
// migrated the hot hook writes to daemon-first enqueue-only routing. Without
// this enforcement gate, the codebase can drift back into "direct writable
// opens", which silently recreates the SQLITE_BUSY contention the plan
// eliminated.
//
// feat-fc3cc9e0 went further: almost every command that used to hold a
// writable file-backed handle (session.go:openDB and everything that
// delegated to it — openPlanDB, openTrackDB, openRecapsIndex, runReindex,
// runServeChild, runWriterOnly, internal/gate/check.go, the whole plan_*.go
// CLI cluster) now opens dbpkg.OpenEphemeralProjection() instead — a
// private, process-local ":memory:" handle, rebuilt from canonical files on
// every call, that structurally cannot contend for a shared file.
// OpenEphemeralProjection calls are NOT tracked by this boundary
// (scanWritableOpens only watches for the Open/OpenWritable method names, and
// OpenEphemeralProjection is neither) — deliberately: an in-memory-per-call
// handle is exactly the property this boundary exists to require, not a
// hazard it needs to police. The seventeen inventory entries that named
// those call sites are gone as of this update, verified individually against
// the current source (not assumed from the test failure) — see the removal
// note above the empty intentional-cli-mutation/reindex-only/migration-only
// section below. The one remaining hook-tree exception is
// core/hooks/dbgate.go:OpenHookDB, the rare canonical-first daemon-miss
// fallback documented in its own classification note below.
//
// This file is the enforcement boundary. It maintains an explicit inventory
// of every first-party Go callsite that opens a writable SQLite handle and
// fails the build when:
//
//  1. A new writable open appears in a forbidden path (hook, collector,
//     indexer, event-capture) without being added to the inventory.
//  2. An inventory entry no longer matches a real callsite (stale entry).
//  3. A forbidden-path entry is mis-classified as something other than
//     daemon-routed-writer-service or canonical-first-hook-fallback (the
//     only forbidden-path classifications still in use).
//     (daemon-routed-pending-slice-6 is RETIRED — no entries use it; any
//     new forbidden-path open must go through the daemon, not add to the
//     legacy pending classification.)
//  4. An ephemeral-in-memory entry's call site does not resolve to a literal
//     ":memory:" DSN (TestEphemeralInMemoryEntriesUseRealMemoryDSN) — the
//     classification's entire safety argument is that literal, and nothing
//     previously checked it.
//
// SCOPE — IMPORTANT:
//
// This boundary scans first-party Go source under cmd/, internal/ ONLY.
// (plugin/ is markdown / static assets only — verified at scan time.)
// MCP servers, third-party plugins, and external tools that open the DB
// file directly are EXPLICITLY OUT OF SCOPE — Go-level enforcement cannot
// reach them. That is a known limitation documented in the plan's review
// critique (review-2026-05-11) and surfaced in the inventory comment for
// the receiver/writer entry.
//
// HOW TO EXTEND:
//
//   - New canonical-first command: no inventory change needed (does not open DB).
//   - New CLI command that legitimately mutates work items: add to inventory
//     with classification "intentional-cli-mutation".
//   - New reindex command: add with "reindex-only".
//   - New schema migration runner: add with "migration-only".
//   - New hook / collector / indexer write path: STOP. Route it through
//     RouteHookWrite / RouteInsertEvent (daemon-first enqueue-only seam,
//     plan-2390966a). Do not add a direct open and do not use the retired
//     daemon-routed-pending-slice-6 classification.
