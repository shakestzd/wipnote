// This file was lazy_reindex.go. It held the cold-clone lazy-rebuild machinery
// — lazySyncReindexHook, ensureIndexPopulated, isIndexWarm, runFullSyncReindex
// — whose whole purpose was deciding WHETHER the persistent read-index needed
// rebuilding before a read (bug-4b07fd94). With the projection now built
// in-process and in-memory (feat-fc3cc9e0) that question has one answer: it is
// always cold, because it did not exist a moment ago. The warmth check, the
// swappable hook and the "run a rebuild first" wrapper were left behind as
// husks that no production caller reached — ensureIndexPopulated's only caller
// (openReadOnlyDB) had already dropped it, and runFullSyncReindex had degenerated
// to building a projection and immediately discarding it. All four are deleted.
//
// hydrateCompatibilityDB is what survived, and it is no longer lazy or
// conditional: it is THE rebuild, run unconditionally by openDB for every
// command that asks for a projection.

// hydrateCompatibilityDB populates an ephemeral projection from the canonical
// .wipnote artifacts. It is the single rebuild path — openDB, the HTTP
// serve_child, the writer daemon and `wipnote reindex` all go through it, so
// every consumer sees the same projection built the same way.
//
// Pass ordering is load-bearing and mirrors the old full-reindex ordering:
//
//   - node passes run FIRST, because agent_events.feature_id carries a foreign
//     key to features(id);
//   - collectPlanIDs and collectSessionIDs must both run BEFORE reindexEdges,
//     which gates every edge on target validity — an unregistered plan or
//     session id silently drops each edge pointing at it (bug-d5eaf6a4,
//     bug-6ec28063);
//   - reindexSessionLedger must precede collectSessionIDs, which is what reads
//     the rows it projects.
//
// Deliberately NOT here: anything that walks git history or the whole sessions
// tree (reindexSessions, reindexCommitTrailers, reindexFeatureFiles,
// reindexArchCards). This function runs on the pre-run path of ordinary
// commands, and that is exactly the full-reindex cost blowup of bug-1f338b5b /
// bug-4e5816f4. Those passes belong to `wipnote reindex`, whose job is the full
// sweep.

//     implemented_in → session edge fail the target-validity gate and get
//     tombstoned even though the session is right there (bug-6ec28063).
//   - reindexSessionLedger inserts a placeholder row for a session it has no
//     telemetry for, and deliberately does not overwrite a richer row that
//     already exists. Run it before the richer source and the placeholder wins
//     permanently.
