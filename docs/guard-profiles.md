# Guard Profiles

A guard profile is a hand-maintained YAML file committed at `.wipnote/guard-profile.yaml`.
It gives wipnote an explicit, version-controlled list of commands to run as quality,
completion, and yolo gates — replacing manifest autodetection with something you own,
diff, and review in pull requests.

---

## Schema

```yaml
guards:
  quality:          # run by `wipnote check --gate`
    - name: <string>               # short identifier shown in gate output (required)
      cmd: <shell command>         # command to run (required, non-empty)
      cwd: <relative path>         # repo-root-relative working dir (optional)
      applies_when:                # narrow when guard is active (optional)
        paths:
          - "internal/**/*.go"     # ** matches zero or more path segments
          - "cmd/**/*.go"
  completion:       # work-item completion gate
    - name: <string>
      cmd: <shell command>
      cwd: <relative path>
      applies_when:
        paths: ["**/*.go"]
  yolo:             # per-commit gate in yolo sessions
    - name: <string>
      cmd: <shell command>
approved:
  signature: "sha256:..."   # content hash; written by wipnote, not by hand
  by: "<git user.name>"     # approver identity
  at: "<RFC3339>"           # UTC approval timestamp
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Short label shown in gate output |
| `cmd` | yes | Shell command; empty string is a validation error |
| `cwd` | no | Repo-root-relative working directory; defaults to repo root |
| `applies_when.paths` | no | Forward-slash globs; guard skipped when no repo file matches. Omit to run unconditionally. |
| `approved.signature` | set by wipnote | Do not edit — any change invalidates approval |
| `approved.by` / `at` | set by wipnote | Git `user.name` and RFC3339 UTC timestamp of approval |

### Phases

| Phase key | When it runs |
|-----------|-------------|
| `quality` | `wipnote check --gate` |
| `completion` | `wipnote feature complete`, `wipnote bug complete`, etc. |
| `yolo` | Per-commit PostToolUse gate in yolo sessions |

All three phases are optional, but an APPROVED profile is authoritative: once a
profile is approved, each gate trusts it and skips manifest autodetection. A phase
you omit (or leave empty) therefore runs **no** guards for that phase — it does
**not** fall back to autodetection. (Autodetection applies only when there is no
approved profile at all.) So if you define `quality` guards but omit `yolo`, the
per-commit yolo gate runs nothing. Define every phase you want enforced.

### Glob semantics

`applies_when.paths` uses forward-slash globs with doublestar semantics:

- `**` matches zero or more path segments (`internal/**/*.go` matches both
  `internal/foo.go` and `internal/pkg/sub/foo.go`).
- `*` does not cross `/` (standard `path.Match` semantics).
- Paths are always repo-root-relative; no leading `./` or absolute paths.
- A guard whose paths match no file in the repo is silently skipped — safe for
  speculative globs.

---

## Approval model and trust boundary

wipnote only honors a profile when `approved.signature` equals the sha256 of the
canonical guard content. The signature covers only the `guards:` block — the `approved:`
block itself is excluded.

**Falls back to autodetection without error when:**
- No profile file present.
- `approved.signature` is empty.
- Signature no longer matches content (edited after approval).
- Validation failure: unknown phase key or empty `cmd`.

In every fallback case wipnote emits a hint to run `wipnote guard init`.

**Order-independence:** the signature is order-independent. Guards are sorted by full
canonical tuple; phases iterate in fixed order (`quality → completion → yolo`);
`applies_when.paths` are sorted. Reformatting YAML or reordering guards does not change
the signature. Adding, removing, or modifying any guard field does.

**Staleness:** passing gate records store the profile signature. A completion validated
against a since-changed profile is reported as stale.

## Setting up a guard profile

### Launch-time proposal (automatic)

Every interactive `wipnote claude`, `wipnote yolo`, `wipnote dev`, `wipnote codex`, and
`wipnote antigravity` launch calls `ensureGuardProfile`:

1. Approved profile exists → no-op.
2. Non-interactive (no TTY) → skip silently, never block.
3. Interactive, no approved profile → inspect manifests, propose a phase-grouped profile,
   print it for review, prompt `[y/N]`.
   - `y`: sign, write `.wipnote/guard-profile.yaml`, commit.
   - `N` (or anything else): defer — re-offered on the next interactive launch.

### Explicit setup and drift re-approval

```bash
wipnote guard init    # propose, review, approve, commit (re-runnable)
```

`wipnote guard init` is always re-runnable. Use it:

- To set up a profile for the first time (interactive or non-interactive context).
- After any edit to the `guards:` section (**drift re-approval**): run it to record a
  fresh `approved.signature` and commit.

The proposal is **prune-not-invent**: it surfaces detected signals with provenance
(e.g. `go.mod`, `Makefile:test`) and flags low-confidence entries. Remove guards you do
not want; do not invent new ones from scratch during approval.

## Polyglot / monorepo example

```yaml
guards:
  quality:
    - name: go-build
      cmd: go build ./...
      cwd: backend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["backend/**/*.go"]
    - name: go-vet
      cmd: go vet ./...
      cwd: backend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["backend/**/*.go"]
    - name: go-test
      cmd: go test ./...
      cwd: backend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["backend/**/*.go"]
    - name: npm-build
      cmd: npm run build
      cwd: frontend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["frontend/**"]
    - name: npm-test
      cmd: npm test
      cwd: frontend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["frontend/**"]
    - name: py-lint
      cmd: uv run ruff check .
      cwd: dataservice
      applies_when:
        paths: ["dataservice/**/*.py"]
    - name: py-test
      cmd: uv run pytest
      cwd: dataservice
      applies_when:
        paths: ["dataservice/**/*.py"]
  completion:
    - name: go-test
      cmd: go test ./...
      cwd: backend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["backend/**/*.go"]
  yolo:
    - name: go-vet
      cmd: go vet ./...
      cwd: backend
      applies_when:
        paths: ["backend/**/*.go"]
approved:
  signature: "sha256:..."
  by: "Alice"
  at: "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
```

Notes:

- `cwd` routes each toolchain to its own subdirectory (relative to repo root).
- `applies_when.paths` gates a guard on whether matching files **exist in the
  repository** — NOT on which files a given commit changed. wipnote does not
  currently inspect the changed-file set, so a guard whose globs match any repo
  file runs on every gate invocation (e.g. in a polyglot repo the Go guard still
  runs on a Python-only commit). Use it to scope guards to a project layout, not
  to skip guards per-commit.
- A guard whose paths match no repo file is silently skipped — safe to include
  even if the directory does not exist yet.
- The `yolo` phase uses a lightweight vet guard to keep per-commit latency low.

---

## Validation rules

- Valid phase keys: `quality`, `completion`, `yolo`. Unknown keys are rejected.
- `cmd` must be non-empty. Validation failures are treated as absent profiles — the
  gate falls back to autodetection rather than erroring out.

---

## File ownership

`.wipnote/guard-profile.yaml` is committed to the repository. Changes belong in pull
requests with the same review process you apply to CI config changes.

Do not hand-edit `approved.signature` — it is computed by `wipnote guard init`. The
signature covers only the `guards:` content and EXCLUDES the `approved:` block, so any
manual change to `guards:` invalidates approval (the gates fall back to autodetection
until you re-approve). Editing `approved.by` or `approved.at` alone does NOT invalidate
approval — only `approved.signature` must continue to match the `guards:` content.

---

## CLI reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `wipnote guard init` | Propose, review, approve, and commit the guard profile (re-runnable) |
| `wipnote check --gate` | Run `quality`-phase guards (autodetects if no approved profile) |
| `wipnote feature complete <id>` | Run `completion`-phase guards at work-item completion |

---

## Emergency hook-guard override (operators only)

The PreToolUse hook guards (store protection, file-overlap block, research and
commit gates) can be disabled wholesale for one shell by setting
`WIPNOTE_GUARDS_OFF=1` in the environment before launching the harness. This is a
break-glass switch for a human operator recovering a stuck session, not a
workflow step: it is deliberately never named in the block messages an agent
reads, and an agent must never export it on its own — it should report the block
instead.

Every tool call honoured under the switch is made visible:

- a `wipnote: WARNING WIPNOTE_GUARDS_OFF=1 is set …` line on the hook's stderr,
- a `[guard_override]` line in `.wipnote/debug.log`,
- a `GuardOverride` check-point agent event (`tool_name = 'GuardOverride'`)
  attributed to the session and its active work item, so "this work was done
  with guards disabled" is part of the lineage.

Prefer the narrower, reviewable knobs where one exists (for example
`block_on_file_overlap` in `.wipnote/config.json`, or a `RESEARCH-WAIVER:` commit
trailer) and unset the variable as soon as the recovery is done.
